    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this University </p>
    <h1>Byee</h1>
    <p>KIIT started in 1992-93 as an Industrial Training Institution. However, 1997 is considered the base year for the University as undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management and Computer Applications were added. In 2007, many new schools were added to its umbrella â€“ School of Law, Biotechnology, Medical Sciences, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Mass Communication, Film and Media, Fashion and KIIT International School. Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, KIIT offers professional education to around 40,000 students from across India. This includes 2000 international students from 65 countries. The alumni of KIIT, over a lakh of them, have made their mark in their respective careers in academics, corporate organizations, civil services and enterprise.</p>
